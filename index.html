										<p> From Mr. Beast to Logan Paul, entertainment YouTubers have had an enormous influence on their viewers. But, sometimes this influence is extremely toxic and we may not even realize it as we become more and more infatuated by our favorite YouTubers, especially now that their audiences become increasingly younger. “The Good And The Bad About Entertainment YouTube” is a blog post I’ve published on Medium which discusses the positive and negative impacts that entertainment YouTubers and their content make on our society.

										<p>Censorship in America is a “touchy issue.” But as enterprises such as Netflix expand their services into cultures around the world, censorship becomes a pressing concern. “Netflix’s Censorship” is a podcast episode by Communication Conundrum which focuses on interesting instances of censorship on Netflix around the world. From Turkey to Brazil, this episode of Communication Conundrum touches on issues of censorship that have led to violence, questions of constitutionality, and more.

										<p>Adopting and raising a kitten for the first time is no small feat, especially if you intend to do it right. Kittens require a lot of preparation, money, time, and patience. However, to achieve all these things, you will have to do A LOT of research. That’s why I made a YouTube video called “My 7 Biggest Tips for First Time Kitten Adopters.” In this video, I talk about my own experience adopting my kitten for the first time and I reveal my biggest point of advice for anyone doing the same. From adoption day to your kitten's first birthday, my video covers 7 of the biggest things you should know before adopting. I also provide specific resources and a document I wrote that goes into more detail. Check this out by clicking the “Learn More” link below!</p>

									<h2 class="major">Other Resources</h2>
									<p>Here are a few other resources that I have used through all of the things I worked on shown above! These include one of my favorite youtube channels, an interesting article about Netflix censorship in Turkey, and a really cool website that I used for months when I was adopting my kittens. As a bonus, I’ve also included some user documentation I created this semester about how to use the YouTube algorithm to your advantage as a user. Enjoy!

											<h3 class="major">Mr.Beast</h3>
											<p>Mr. Beast is a very popular channel on YouTube who’s creator uses the millions of dollars of revenue produced from the channel to make really fun and interesting videos about donating to things like charities, animal shelters, etc. and doing other genuinely amazing things for society. For example, he once bought every item from a local grocery store with the money he earned from his channel and donated everything to a homeless shelter. He also hosts really fun events that collaborate with a wide range of popular YouTubers so his content touches on a variety of categories. Mr. Beasts content is family friendly, entertaining, and inspiring, and every subscription he gets allows him to do bigger and crazier charitable videos. Check out his channel by clicking on the “Learn More” link below!</p>

											<h3 class="major">"Netflix Expands Into a World Full of Censors" - New York Times</h3>
											<p>Through my research relating to the podcast episode I worked on with Communication Conundrum, I found issues of Netflix censorship in Turkey to be particularly interesting. The Turkish government holds Netflix accountable for these issues and Netflix has a lot of problems streaming popular shows in the country for a number of reasons. The New York Times posted an article about a range of instances in which certain shows in Netflix have been censored because of things like sexuality, indecency, etc. This article describes the troubles Netflix has with navigating these obstacles and their responses to issues of censorship as well.

											<h3 class="major">Petfinder</h3>
											<p>Recently I have adopted two kittens, and the process was a lot more challenging than I thought it would be. I took months finding my kittens and researching what I needed to give them the best life they could have. One resource I used over and over again was Petfinder. I found my kittens on this website and I used a lot of their advice like their pre-adoption checklist to learn about the process. On this website, you can search for a range of different pets in any specific area and you can filter them by age, color, etc. A lot of animal shelters and breeders use this website so you will definitely find the perfect companion for you here.

											<h3 class="major">YouTube Algorithm User Documentation</h3>
											<p>This semester in my Creating User Documentation class, I made user documentation for navigating entertainment YouTube content strategically by manipulating the YouTube algorithm. The YouTube algorithm keeps track of the videos you’ve watched, interacted with, and searched for and it tailor's what it recommends to you based on these things. Therefore, if you want to find new and interesting entertainment content that is relevant to you without even leaving the home page, it is important for you to understand how to use the YouTube algorithm to your advantage. You can learn how to do this through my user documentation by clicking on the “Learn More” link below!</p>
